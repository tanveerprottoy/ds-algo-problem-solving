# tips for recursive problem
1. first think of the simplest possible input. the simplest possible input
most often play as the base case for the recursive algo
2. visaulize the inputs and outputs, write down and form the tree
for the recursive algo
3. compare hard cases for the larger input with the simpler cases
for smaller input, find the pattern in them, in recursive algo
often the computation builds upon from smaller to larger blocks
4. figure out and generalize the pattern


# tips for dp problem
1. observe, identify and solve the subproblems(smaller parts of the problem)
2. use the subproblems to solve the large problem
